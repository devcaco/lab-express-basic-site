          Warren Buffett, in full Warren Edward Buffett, (born August 30, 1930,
          Omaha, Nebraska, U.S.), American businessman and philanthropist,
          widely considered the most successful investor of the 20th and early
          21st centuries, having defied prevailing investment trends to amass a
          personal fortune of more than $100 billion.
        </p>

          Known as the “Oracle of Omaha,” Buffett was the son of U.S. Rep.
          Howard Homan Buffett from Nebraska. After graduating from the
          University of Nebraska (B.S., 1950), he studied with Benjamin Graham
          at the Columbia University School of Business (M.S., 1951). In 1956
          Buffett returned to Omaha and in 1965 took majority control of the
          textile manufacturer Berkshire Hathaway Inc., turning it into his
          primary investment vehicle. From the 1960s through the ’90s the major
          stock averages rose by roughly 11 percent annually, but Berkshire
          Hathaway’s publicly traded shares gained about 28 percent per year.
          Though Buffett’s success with Berkshire Hathaway made him one of the
          world’s wealthiest men, he eschewed lavish spending and criticized
          governmental policies and taxation that favoured the rich over the
          middle or lower classes.

          In June 2006 Buffett announced that he planned to donate more than 80
          percent of his wealth to charitable foundations; in 2020 he raised
          that amount to 99 percent. The main recipient was the Bill & Melinda
          Gates Foundation—created by Microsoft founder Bill Gates and his then
          wife, Melinda—which focused on issues of world health and education;
          Bill and Buffett had maintained a close friendship since the early
          1990s. The other organizations receiving donations included those run
          by Buffett’s three children and the Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation,
          named for his late wife, which focused on women’s reproductive rights
          and funded college scholarship programs. In 2010 Buffett and the
          Gateses created the Giving Pledge, an invitation to other wealthy
          individuals to donate the majority of their fortune to charities.

          During the subprime mortgage crisis of 2007–08, Buffett made a number
          of deals that, though questioned at the time, proved highly
          profitable. In September 2008 he invested $5 billion in the U.S.-based
          bank holding company Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., and the following
          month Berkshire Hathaway purchased $3 billion in General Electric
          Company (GE) preferred stock. In November 2009 Buffett announced that
          Berkshire was buying the railroad company Burlington Northern Santa Fe
          Corporation for about $26 billion; the investment group already owned
          approximately 23 percent of the railroad. Berkshire Hathaway also had
          significant shareholdings in companies it did not control, including
          Coca Cola and Apple.In 2011 Buffett was awarded the Presidential Medal
          of Freedom.
